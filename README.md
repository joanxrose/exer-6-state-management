# Exercise 06
  &emsp; This flutter app allows users to add items to their cart, and checkout those items. These are made possible using Flutter's state management (Providers).

## Things I Did in the Code
  &emsp; For this exercise, I implemented the Checkout functionality, and made slight modifications on the UI of all the screens.

## Challenges
  &emsp; I was a bit confused on how to use Providers at first, but browsing through the Flutter documentation helped. I also had some difficulties with changing the layouts of the screens.
